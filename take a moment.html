<div class="poem"> 
<p>"Today I want you to know,
  That I care about you, even if weâ€™ve yet to meet.
  You are important to me, no questions asked,
  Take a moment to be yourself, complete.</p>
  
 <p> Step into a peaceful thought, and stay,
  Let your worries gently drift away.
  I am cheering for you, from near and far,
  You're a brilliant light, a radiant star.</p>
  
 <p> Even when you don't know how or when to shine,
  Remember, your light is uniquely divine.
  So take heart and cherish who you are,
  For to me, you're perfect, just as you are."
